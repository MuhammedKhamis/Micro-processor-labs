* You are required to make the motor rotate according to the number you send. For example: in order to make the motor rotate at 180 degrees, you send ‘1’ then ‘8’ then ‘0’ then ‘Menu’ or any other function key and the motor should perfrom the correct rotation.

* The Volume up and down keys should make the motor angle increase or decrease by 10 degrees.

* Attach one of the gears to the motor to show its current position.
