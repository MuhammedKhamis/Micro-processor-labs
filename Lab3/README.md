## Analog to digital converter

* We take the reading from temperature sensor ( analog sensor ).

* We convert the value read from the sensor to volts and compare it with our threshold.

* If the value exceeded the threshold, a led will light up as indicator for exceeding the threshold.

* If the value reduced the led turns off.
