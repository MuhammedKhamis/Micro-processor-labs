## Temperature warning system

* Use the LM35 to measure the current air temperature and print the readings in Centigrade (°C) on the serial monitor.

* Use the IR receiver (IR1383) to set a temperature threshold using your remote control. You should assume that the user will enter any number of digits and then click “OK button” to set the threshold.

* If the temperature exceeds this threshold) , a buzzer and an LED must turn ON. If it drops below (threshold-1) then the LED and buzzer should stop.
