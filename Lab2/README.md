![Traffic Light](Lab2/traffic_light.png)

* Pedestrian traffic lights allow any person who wishes to cross the road to press a button which triggers an alert for the trafic light system to change light into “green” and allow him to cross.

* We are asked to simulate a similar system using your arduino kit, 2 LEDs, a push-button or a switch.

* Normal operation is that only one LED is active (ON) at any moment. A LED stays on for 2 seconds then it
becomes (OFF) and the other LED becomes ON and stays for 2 seconds then the cycle continues.

* If the switch or push button are pressed then the LEDs should invert their states instantly (The one that was (ON)
becomes (OFF) and the one that was (OFF) becomes (ON)) and stay at these new states for 2 seconds and then
invert states for 2 seconds and so on.

* Every time the switch or push button are pressed the LED states must change instantly and the 2 seconds counter
starts.

* In case of push button, you press and release .

* In case of switch, each press changes the state of the switch itself.
