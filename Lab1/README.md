# Lab 1

Represent any character in Morse Code using the Arduino UNO by using the built-in LED in the Arduino. The time unit can be 100 ms.


The message	that needs to be represented is	passed	to the Arduino	using the Serial Monitor. The end of the message is indicated by a new line character.


## Morse Code:

## International Morse code five elements representation:


 * dot (.): one time unit long.
 * dash (-): three time units long.
 * inter-element gap (between characters in the same word): one unit long.
 * short gap (between letters): three time units long.
 *  medium gap (between words): seven time units long.
